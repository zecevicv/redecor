        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>Effective as of 25th of May 2022</p>
        <p>The Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") you are reading are a legally binding agreement that governs
          the relationship between Reworks Oy, Runeberginkatu 5, 00100 Helsinki, Finland (“<strong>Reworks</strong>”)
          and yourself ("<strong>you</strong>") and your use of Reworks’ products and social games for the web, mobile
          or any other applicable platforms and/or devices (the “<strong>Service or Services</strong>”).</p>
        <p>Please review the Terms carefully.&nbsp;<strong>They include a provision waiving the right to pursue any
            class, group or representative claim and requiring you to pursue certain disputes through individual
            arbitration (where permissible) unless you opt-out within the specified time frame.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>BY ACCESSING OR USING REWORKS’ SERVICE AND ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD
          AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.</p>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS STRICTLY FOR AMUSEMENT PURPOSES ONLY. THE SERVICE DOES NOT OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN REAL
          MONEY OR REAL-WORLD PRIZES. NO ACTUAL MONEY OR ANYTHING OF VALUE CAN BE WON ENGAGING WITH THE SERVICE, AND NO
          ACTUAL MONEY IS REQUIRED TO USE THE APP, EVEN THOUGH THE SERVICE MAY OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE CERTAIN
          VIRTUAL ITEMS.</p>
        <p>In these Terms, “<strong>Reworks</strong>” refers to Reworks Oy and its affiliates, which shall mean
          subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership. We may
          also refer to Reworks as "we" or "us".</p>
        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Reworks owns and operates Redecor.</p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>
            <h2>CHANGES TO THE TERMS OR THE SERVICE</h2>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Reworks reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revise or modify these Terms, our Privacy Policy
          including any other rules related to specific services like platforms and APIs, applications for mobile
          devices (“app(s)”), forums, contests, or subscriptions, that we may publish which apply to your use of those
          specific services and state they are part of these Terms (“Additional Terms”) (the Terms, Privacy Policy and
          Additional Terms collectively shall be referred to herein as “Reworks’ Terms”), at any time by posting the
          amended Reworks’ Terms on or within the Service, and you agree to be bound by such revisions or modifications.
          In addition, Reworks may terminate these Terms in its sole discretion at any time. Users are responsible for
          viewing Reworks’ Terms periodically. Your continued use of the Service after a change or modification of
          Reworks’ Terms has been made will constitute your acceptance of the revised Reworks’ Terms. If you do not
          agree to Reworks’ Terms your only remedy is to discontinue your use of the Service and to cancel any accounts
          you have created using the Service. If you use our Service, you must follow all Reworks’ Terms that may apply.
          If you access the Service from a social network or download the Service from another platform or applications
          stores, such as but not limited to, Facebook, Amazon, Windows Phone, Samsung, Yahoo, Apple or Google, you must
          also comply with its terms of service/use as well as Reworks’ Terms.</p>
        <p>You understand that the Service is evolving. You may be required to accept updates to the Service, and to
          Reworks’ apps and games which you have installed on your computer, mobile device or any other device. You
          acknowledge that Reworks may perform these updates remotely and agree that Reworks may update the Service with
          or without notifying you. You may need to update third party software from time to time in order to receive
          the Service and use the Reworks’ app(s). We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, temporarily
          or permanently, with or without notice, in whole or in part, to: stop offering and/or supporting the Service
          or any particular app or part of the Service; terminate or suspend your license to use the Service or any part
          of it; modify or discontinue the Service; modify or remove any of the information contained in the Service;
          limit the Service’s availability to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction we choose; charge fees in
          connection with the use of the Service; modify and/or waive any fees charged in connection with the Service;
          and/or offer opportunities to some and all users of the Service. If that happens, Reworks is not required to
          provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to users in connection with discontinued elements of the
          Service or for virtual goods previously awarded or purchased. You agree that we will not be liable to you or
          to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service, in whole or in part.
          Your continued use of the Service after such changes will indicate your acceptance of such changes in the
          Services and in Reworks’ Terms.</p>
        <p>Reworks may modify and adapt the Services and their scope of functions to maintain and improve the Services
          beyond what is necessary to maintain their contractual conformity (a “Modification”), if a valid reason
          requires such Modification, in particular (i) to comply with legal, regulatory or safety requirements, (ii) to
          adapt to technological developments such as a new technical environment or other operational reasons, in
          particular necessary enhancements of the safety of users or other third parties, (iii) to adapt to significant
          changes in market conditions or user behavior such as increased user numbers, (iv) due to changes in licenses
          we hold from third parties or other third party compliance requirements, or (v) for your benefit or to your
          advantage.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We also&nbsp;reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, with or
          without notice, in whole or in part, to: stop offering and/or supporting the Service or any particular game or
          part of the Service; terminate or suspend your license to use the Service or any part of it; modify or
          discontinue the Services; modify or remove any of the information contained in the Services; limit the
          Services' availability to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction we choose; charge fees in connection
          with the use of the Services; modify and/or waive any fees charged in connection with the Services; and/or
          offer opportunities to some and all users of the Services. If that happens, unless otherwise required by
          applicable law,&nbsp;Playtika is not required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to players in
          connection with discontinued elements of the Service or for Virtual Items&nbsp;previously awarded or
          purchased. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension
          or discontinuance of the Services, in whole or in part. Your continued use of the Services after such changes
          will indicate your acceptance of such changes in the Services and in the Playtika's Terms.</p>

          <li>
            <h2>ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h2>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To access or use our apps you must create an account with Reworks (an “Account”). You may access the Service
          via the website, your account in a social network, like Facebook, or, if you are using our mobile Service, an
          account with the company that provides your mobile applications, such as an Apple account. The Service may
          have limited and varied compatibility across different devices, platforms and operating systems. You will have
          to verify compatibility requirements yourself and may need to update third party software from time to time to
          receive the Service and/or updates and play Reworks’ games or use its apps. During the process of creating an
          Account to access the Service, you may be required to select a password or to allow us to access your account
          information from a social network service (“<strong>Login Information</strong>”). The following rules govern
          the security of your Account and Login Information. For the purposes of these Terms, references to Account and
          Login Information shall include any account information, including user names, passwords or security
          questions, whether or not created for the purpose of using the Service, that are used to access the Service
          (for example, account information for a social network service account from which the Service is accessed):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>You shall not share your Account or Login Information, nor let anyone else access your Account or do
              anything else that might jeopardize the security of your Account. Reworks will not ask you to reveal your
              password and will not initiate contact with you asking for answers to your password security questions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In the event you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including, without
              limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your Login Information or unauthorized access to
              your Account, you must&nbsp;<em>immediately</em> notify Reworks and modify your Login Information if
              appropriate.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Login Information, and you will be
              responsible for all uses of your Login Information, including purchases, whether or not authorized by you
              and ensure that you "log off" or exit from your Account (if applicable) at the end of each session.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You are responsible for anything that happens through your Account, whether or not such actions were
              taken by you. You therefore acknowledge that your Account may be terminated if someone else uses it to
              engage in any activity that violates these Terms or is otherwise improper or illegal.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You undertake to monitor your Account to restrict use by those not meeting our Age Guidelines, and you
              will deny access to persons as set forth in our Age Guidelines. You accept full responsibility for any
              unauthorized use of the Service by minors and you acknowledge that you are responsible for any use of your
              credit card or other payment instrument (for example PayPal) by minors.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You shall not have more than one Account per platform or social network, at any given time, and shall not
              create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf of someone other than yourself.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You shall not have an Account or use the Service if you have previously been removed by Reworks or
              previously been banned from using any Reworks game or app.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The Services are subject to export and sanction laws and regulations, including laws and regulations
              administered and enforced by the United States, Israel, the European Union, and, if applicable, the laws
              of the jurisdiction in which the Services were obtained. You must comply with all applicable export and
              sanction laws and regulations. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. You
              may not use or otherwise export, re-export, divert, transfer, or disclose any portion of the Services or
              any related technical information or materials, directly or indirectly, except as authorized by U.S., E.U.
              or Israeli law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Services were obtained. In particular, but
              without limitation, the Services may not be exported, re-exported, diverted, transferred, or disclosed (a)
              into any country or territory which is the target of sanctions by the U.S. government (currently, Cuba,
              Iran, Syria, North Korea, or the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine) or any countries
              designated as an “enemy” under Israel’s Trading with the Enemy Ordinance of 1939 (each a
              “<strong>Sanctioned Country</strong>”) or (b) to anyone or any entity on any list of prohibited persons or
              entities maintained by the U.S., E.U. or Israeli governments, including the U.S. Treasury’s Office of
              Foreign Assets Control’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons or the U.S. Department
              of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List, any entity 50% or more
              owned or, where applicable, controlled, by any such person or persons or acting for or on behalf of such
              person or persons, or anyone or any entity organized or resident in a Sanctioned Country (a
              “<strong>Sanctioned Person</strong>”). By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not
              located in, under the control of, or a resident of any Sanctioned Country and are not a Sanctioned Person.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You must provide the equipment (computer, mobile device, tablet, etc.) necessary to connect to the
              Service. You are responsible to pay any fees, including Internet connection or mobile fees, or for data or
              cellular usage to download and use the Service.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To the extent permissible under applicable law, we are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your
          failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.</p>
        <p>Reworks reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including but
          not limited to claims by a third party that a username violates a third party's rights.</p>
        <p>You understand that your user ID number, name and profile picture will be publicly available and that search
          engines may index your name and profile picture.</p>
        <p>Any personal information you provide to us when creating or updating your Account, which may include your
          name, birth date, e-mail address, and, in some cases, payment information, will be held and used in accordance
          with Reworks’ Privacy Policy and any applicable laws. You agree that you will supply accurate and complete
          information to us, and that you will update that information promptly after it changes.</p>
        <p>By providing contact information to us, you agree that we may send You promotional or marketing messages to
          the e-mail address and/or telephone number (either via voice call or SMS text) You provided. For more
          information about marketing communications, including how to opt-out, please see the Data Subjects’ Rights
          section of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redecor.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>You may stop using the Service at any time and may request that we stop making active use of your data at any
          time by following the instructions in the Privacy Policy. Unless the applicable law where you are located
          requires otherwise, we are not required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation if you request

        <p>Subject to your agreement and continuing compliance with the Reworks’ Terms, Reworks grants you a personal,
          non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub licensable, revocable, limited scope license to access and use the
          Service using a Reworks supported web browser or mobile device. Use of the Service shall be solely for your
          own, private, non-commercial entertainment purposes and for no other purpose whatsoever. Reworks’ Terms do not
          grant you or any other party any right, title or interest in the Service or any content in the Service. You
          hereby acknowledge that your license to use the Service is limited by Reworks’ Terms, and, if you violate or
          if, at any point, you do not agree to any of Reworks’ Terms, your license to use the Service shall immediately
          terminate, and you shall immediately refrain from using the Service. If the Service or any part thereof is
          determined to be illegal under the laws of the country in which you are situated, you shall not be granted any
          license to use the Service and must refrain from using the Service.</p>

          to be subject to the terms of a third party software license (a “Third Party License”), including any open
          source software license (“Open Source License”), then the terms of that Open Source License or other Third
          Party License will apply to such Open Source Components or other Third Party Component independent of the
          terms of these Terms. All other Third Party Components are subject to the terms of these Terms and may be used
          only under the terms of these Terms. Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit any rights under, or to grant
          rights or impose restrictions that supersede, the terms of any Open Source License or other Third Party
          License applicable to any Open Source Component or other Third Party Component. If required by an applicable
          Open Source License, you may obtain a copy of the Open Source Component subject to that Open Source License by

            <h2>IN-APP CURRENCIES AND GOODS</h2>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is never any requirement to make any purchase of any kind to use the Service. The Service may include
          an opportunity to earn or purchase virtual, in-app currency, including but not limited to virtual tokens,
          gold, cash, points, credits, or bonuses, all for use in the Service ("<strong>Virtual Currency</strong>") or
          virtual in-app items or collections (together with the Virtual Currency, “Virtual Items”). A certain number of
          Virtual Currency will be made available to you to collect when you log into the Service at recurring time
          intervals. If you exhaust your supply of Virtual Currency, you may elect to purchase additional Virtual
          Currency and continue to engage with the app through the Service or you may wait until additional free Virtual
          Currency is available to you. Virtual Currency and other Virtual Items are licensed to you by us for your use
          through the Service, subject to the limitations and other terms set out in greater detail below.</p>
        <p>If you wish to purchase Virtual Currency or other Virtual Items, you will be required to pay a fee using
          “real world” money to obtain the Virtual Items. Virtual Items do not have an equivalent “real world” money
          value and can never be redeemed or cashed out for “real world” money, goods, or any other item of monetary
          value from Reworks or any other party. You understand that you have no right or title in the Virtual Items
          appearing or originating in any Reworks app, whether “awarded” in the app or “purchased” from Reworks, or any
          other attributes associated with an Account or stored on the Service. Except for when you exercise your right
          to withdrawal, your purchase of Virtual Items is final and is not refundable, transferable or exchangeable,
          except in Reworks’ sole discretion. You may not transfer, purchase, sell, or exchange Virtual Items outside
          the Service, or attempt to sell, give or trade in the "real world" anything that appears or originates in the
          Service unless otherwise expressly authorized by Reworks in writing. We won't recognize those transfers as
          legitimate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for "real" money,
          or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of an app or game, without Reworks’ written
          permission. Doing so is a violation of these Terms and may result in termination of your Account and/or legal
          action taken against you, any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void. Other than a
          limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicense able license to use the Virtual Items with the
          Service, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Items appearing or originating with the
          Services, or any other attributes associated with use of the Services or stored within the Services. Reworks
          retains the right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Virtual Items at its sole discretion,
          and Reworks shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. Prices and availability
          of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. In addition to the foregoing, Reworks may selectively
          remove or revoke Virtual Items associated with your Account upon its sole discretion.</p>
        <p>Virtual Items may only be held by legal residents of countries where access to and use of the Service are
          permitted. Virtual Items may only be purchased or acquired from us and through means we provide on the
          applicable website or otherwise expressly authorize. Reworks does not recognize any purchases or transfers
          made outside of the Service on any other platform or e-commerce website and shall not be liable for any claims
          or damages caused to the users with respect to Virtual Items purchased or obtained from third parties, and not
          through the means provided within the game. We reserve the right to refuse your request to purchase and/or
          acquire Virtual Items for any reason or revise the pricing for the Virtual Items at any time. You can get a
          limited license to Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in our app, providing your billing information,
          confirming the particulars of your purchase and re-affirming your agreement to these Terms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Virtual Items purchased in our games and apps on other applications stores or platforms such as but not
          limited to Facebook, Apple iOS, or Android will be subject to those platforms' payment terms and conditions.
          Reworks does not control how you can pay on those platforms and shall not be liable for processing the payment
          by such third parties. Please review those platforms' terms of service for additional information. Your order
          for Virtual Items will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license for the relevant service(s) or
          virtual in-game item(s) which will be accepted by us when we make the Virtual Items available in your account
          for you to use in our games or debit your credit card or other account through which you paid, whichever comes
          first. Your limited license to Virtual Items for use in Reworks apps is a service provided by Reworks that
          starts when we accept your payment or redemption of third party virtual currency. When you get a limited
          license to use Virtual Items, they will reside in your Account until discharged through use of the Service or
          otherwise surrendered as a result of termination of the Service in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When purchasing Virtual Items or other content as may be made available, you agree to pay us the applicable
          charges for your purchase, including applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to
          you, using a valid charge card or other payment method we may accept in accordance with the billing terms and
          prices in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. All sales of Virtual Items and/or other
          content are final. If your Account is charged for items you did not purchase, or you did not receive the items
          you purchased, or you were charged an incorrect amount, you may request a refund or correction in accordance
          with payment provider policy. Any refund request must be received within 96 hours from the time of purchase in
          order for refunds to be issued in accordance with payment provider policy. Refund requests past 96 hours from
          time of purchase will be honored only in accordance with our payment policy.</p>
        <p>Other than charges to your Account, you agree to notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within
          30 days after they first appear on your Account statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 30
          days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. You are responsible for
          and agree to reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability
          incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you
          authorized or accepted. You understand that we may suspend or terminate your Account if for any reason a
          charge you authorize us to make to your credit card or other method of payment cannot be processed or is
          returned to us unpaid and, if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge
          through an alternative payment method.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that Reworks is not required to provide a refund for any other reason, and that you will not
          receive money or other compensation for unused virtual items when an Account is closed, whether such closure
          was voluntary or involuntary, or whether you made a payment through&nbsp;<a
            href="https://www.reworksgames.com/">www.reworksgames.com</a>, applications stores or another platform such

        <p>If you withdraw from the contract, you are entitled to be reimbursed for the purchase not later than 14 days

          carried out using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you have agreed
          otherwise; in any event you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>

        <p>In no event will Reworks, its affiliates or subsidiaries, or any of their directors, officers, agents,

          defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct by any third party, including other users of the Service and
          operators of external sites and that the risk of harm or damage from the foregoing rests entirely with you.

        <p>To the fullest extent permissible under applicable laws, under no circumstances will Reworks, its affiliates
          or subsidiaries, or any of their directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees be liable to
          you for more than the amount you have paid Reworks in the ninety days (90) days immediately preceding the date
          on which you first assert any such claim. You acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid Reworks any
          amounts in the ninety days (90) days immediately preceding the date on which you first assert any such claim,
          your sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute with Reworks is to stop using the Service and to cancel your
          account.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer or exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or
          exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Therefore, some of the above limitations in this Section
          may not apply to you. In particular, nothing in these Terms shall affect the statutory rights of any consumer
          or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of
          Reworks. In such jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
          law.</p>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to release, discharge, defend, indemnify and hold Reworks,
          and each of its affiliates and subsidiaries, or any of their directors, officers, agents, contractors,
          partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and
          expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with:</p>
        <p>(i) Your use or misuse of and access to the Service;<br>&nbsp;(ii) Your violation of any term of Reworks’
          Terms;<br>&nbsp;(iii) Your breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made herein;<br>&nbsp;(iv)
          Your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy
          right;<br>&nbsp;(v) Any claim that a user submissions made by you has caused damage to a third party;
          or<br>&nbsp;(vi) Any User Content you post or share on or through the Service.</p>
        <p>Reworks reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
          which you are required to indemnify Reworks, and you agree to cooperate with Reworks’ defense of these claims.
          Reworks will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware
          of it.</p>
        <p>You agree that the provisions in this paragraph and Section 15 below will survive any termination of your

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE, WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW, IT REQUIRES YOU AND
            REWORKS TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU
            AND REWORKS CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER.</strong></p>
        <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you and Reworks agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims
          or causes of action between you and Reworks arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Service, the
          formation of these Terms or any other dispute between you and Reworks or any of Reworks’ licensors,
          distributors, suppliers or agents (including but not limited to any application store or platform from which
          the Service is accessed or downloaded), and whether arising prior to or after your agreement to this Section,
          (collectively, “Dispute(s)”) will be governed by the procedure outlined below. You and Reworks further agree
          that any arbitration pursuant to this Section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action.
        </p>
        <p>“Country of Residence” for purposes of this Section 15 means the country in which you hold citizenship or
          legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you regularly access and use the Service. If more
          than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence
          shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent
          residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent
          residence.</p>
        <p>If your Country of Residence is in the European Economic Area, no provision in this Section 15 shall exclude
          or restrict any of your statutory rights you may have as a consumer.</p>
        <p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.</strong></p>
        <p>(a.1) If your Country of Residence is the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with
          the laws of the Country of Finland without regard to conflicts or choice-of-law principles. The agreement to
          arbitrate contained in this Section 15, its scope and its enforcement shall also be governed by the United
          States Federal Arbitration Act without regard to conflict- or choice-of-law principles.</p>
        <p>(a.2) If your Country of Residence is not the United States, these Terms, including the arbitration agreement
          contained in this Section 15, will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Country of Finland
          without regard to conflict- or choice-of-law principles.</p>
        <p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>Informal Dispute Resolution.&nbsp;</strong>Reworks wants to address your concerns without
          needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Reworks, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute
          informally by contacting&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Legal-Redecor@playtika.com">Legal-Redecor@playtika.com</a>.
          Similarly, Reworks will undertake reasonable efforts to contact you (if we have contact information for you)
          to resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any formal action. If a dispute is not resolved
          within 15 days after the email noting the Dispute is sent, you or Reworks may initiate an arbitration
          proceeding as described below.</p>
        <p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>We Both Agree To Arbitrate</strong>. By agreeing to these Terms, to the extent legally
          permissible to do so in your Country of Residence, you and Reworks each and both agree to resolve any Disputes
          through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein, except as set forth under “Exceptions to Agreement
          To Arbitrate” below.</p>
        <p>(d)&nbsp;<strong>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>. You may decline this agreement to arbitrate by
          contacting Legal-Redecor@playtika.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms and stating that you
          (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement. By opting out of the agreement to
          arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the Service, but you and Reworks will not permitted to invoke
          the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided herein.</p>
        <p>(e)&nbsp;<strong>Residents of the State of Washington, USA.</strong> If you are a resident of the State of
          Washington or were a resident of that state while using the Service at any time since January 1, 2014, then
          this Section 15 does not apply to you, with the sole exception of the choice of law (Finland) set out in (a.1)
          above.&nbsp;<strong>For clarity, residents of the State of Washington are not agreeing to arbitrate and need
            take no action to avoid application of the agreement to arbitrate</strong>.</p>
        <p>(f)&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Procedures and Fees</strong>.</p>
        <p>(f.1) If your Country of Residence is the United States, you and Reworks agree that the American Arbitration
          Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules
          and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes in effect at the time arbitration is sought.
          Those rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Arbitration will proceed on
          an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. You and Reworks
          further agree that the arbitration will be held in Los Angeles, California, or, at your election, will be
          conducted telephonically or via other remote electronic means. The AAA rules will govern payment of all
          arbitration fees.</p>
        <p>(f.2) If your Country of Residence is not the United States, you and Reworks agree that the Arbitration
          Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce (FAI) will administer the arbitration, which shall be conducted
          in accordance with its rules in effect at the time arbitration is sought, and in accordance with the Finnish
          Arbitration Act, 967/1992, as amended. Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by
          a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. You and Reworks further agree that the arbitration will be
          held in English and in Helsinki, Finland, or, if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted telephonically
          or via other remote electronic means. The FAI rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.</p>
        <p>(g)&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Shall Proceed Individually</strong>. Regardless of your County of Residence or
          the rules of a given arbitration forum, you and Reworks agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall
          proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor Reworks may bring a claim as a part of a class, group,
          collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a “<strong>Collective Arbitration</strong>”).
          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and as an illustrative but not exhaustive example), a claim
          to resolve any Dispute against Reworks will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (i) two (2) or more similar
          claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (ii) counsel for
          the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. “Concurrently” for purposes of
          this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.</p>
        <p>(h)&nbsp;<strong>Class Action and Collective Arbitration Waiver.&nbsp;</strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
          PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR REWORKS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE
          DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION (AS DEFINED
          ABOVE) OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER
          OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY
          AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
          SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, IN THE EVENT ALL OR ANY PORTION OF SUBSECTIONS (G) OR (H) OF THIS SECTION 15
          (DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS) ARE FOUND TO BE INVALID OR LESS THAN
          FULLY ENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS SECTION 15 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN
          INDIVIDUAL BASIS) MAY BE DEEMED VOID AND AS HAVING NO EFFECT UPON EITHER PARTY’S ELECTION.</p>
        <p>(i)&nbsp;<strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.&nbsp;</strong>Notwithstanding your and Reworks’
          agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Reworks may bring a lawsuit in a court of law asserting causes
          of action which seek only temporary injunctive relief until an arbitrator can be empaneled and determine
          whether to continue, modify or terminate such relief, to compel arbitration pursuant to this Section 15 or to
          enforce any arbitral award issued hereunder. Additionally:</p>
        <p>(i.1) If your Country of Residence is the United Kingdom or in the European Economic Area, notwithstanding
          your and Reworks’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Reworks also may assert claims, if they
          qualify, through the small claims process in the courts of your Country of Residence. If your Country of
          Residence is in the European Economic Area, you may also use the Online Dispute Resolution platform offered by
          the European Commission&nbsp;<a
            href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a> . Please note that
          Playtika shall not be required to use this or any other alternative dispute resolution platform.</p>
        <p>(i.2) If your Country of Residence is not the United States, the United Kingdom or in the European Economic
          Area, notwithstanding your and Reworks’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Reworks may also assert
          claims, if they qualify, through the Small Claims Court (or local equivalent court) in Helsinki, Finland, or
          if a court in your Country of Residence would not recognize such a requirement (notwithstanding the provisions
          of this Section), then in a small claims court or the equivalent in your Country of Residence.</p>
        <p>(j)<strong>&nbsp;Judicial Forum for Disputes.&nbsp;</strong>Except as otherwise required by applicable law or
          provided in this Section 15, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your
          claim, you and Reworks agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court of competent
          jurisdiction in Helsinki, Finland. Both you and Reworks consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.</p>

          subsection will prevent Reworks from modifying Reworks’ Terms.</p>
        <p>You and Reworks agree that if any portion of the Reworks’ Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole
          or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
          ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the
          validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining
          provisions of Reworks’ Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>Reworks may assign or delegate Reworks’ Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with
          or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under Reworks’ Terms without
          Reworks’ prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void and ineffective.
        </p>
        <p>The failure of Reworks to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of Reworks’ Terms or
          failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Reworks’
          right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by
          Reworks of any provision, condition, or requirement of Reworks’ Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any
          future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and
          specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts
          or omissions by Reworks shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding, unless
          documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Reworks.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under Reworks’ Terms to Reworks are of a unique
          and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Reworks and which cannot be replaced by
          monetary damages alone. Accordingly, Reworks shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief
          (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or
          anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or
          to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Service or any Reworks game, exploitation of any advertising or
          other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the Service or any content or other
          material used or displayed through the Service and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages,
          limited by Section “Limitation of Liability” set forth above (if any).</p>
        <p>The headings titles in these Terms are provided solely for convenience and have no legal or contractual
          significance.</p>
        <p>Reworks shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable
          control of Reworks, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen
          circumstances or cause beyond Reworks’ control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of
          civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, network infrastructure failures, strikes, or shortages
          of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>
